Look at the code in project. I currently compare frequency distributions. We need to compare LDA distributions. 

- We need to add back in the words removed when we removed the stopwords. Maybe steal the code from the insert CSP solver?
Perhaps we can read in a corpus and do a simple markov model... we'll just be filling in simple verbs and articles

- We also need to remove the non unicode characters
