As Chinese incomes rose, the widening networks for giving gifts—and the obligation never to give less than you last received—have fed a sharp upward spiral in gift amounts, a ruinous development for the poor. At a typical banquet guests line up to give cash at a reception table, where someone records the amount and the name of the guest in the family’s gift ledger. In Popu village, where the average annual income is less than $1,000, close friends and relatives must give at least 100 yuan ($16), compared with 10 or 20 yuan a decade ago. (In the mountains of Hubei province, some farmers hold banquets when their pigs give birth.)

If Ms Wang wants to try earning her money back, she is out of luck for now, lacking an occasion.
