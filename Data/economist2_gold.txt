The federal website through which Americans in 36 states are supposed to buy health insurance, and which opened with great fanfare on October 1st, is still riddled with problems. Mr Obama is shifting responsibility to state insurance commissioners, who must decide whether to allow the extensions, and to insurers, who must decide whether to offer them. The insurance lobby points out that Mr Obama’s plan will dissuade healthy people from buying more generous, costly coverage on the exchanges. With new competition from older, skimpier plans, Mr Obama must make it as easy as possible to sign up for insurance on the exchanges. Health spending accounts for nearly 18% of GDP, about twice the OECD average, even as 15% of Americans lack insurance.
