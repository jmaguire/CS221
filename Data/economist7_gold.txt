SINCE taking office in September Raghuram Rajan, the governor of India’s central bank, has championed financial-sector liberalisation as a way to boost growth and help the poor. After Indira Gandhi, then prime minister, nationalised most banks in 1969, India slipped towards financial socialism, with a central bank that printed rupees on politicians’ command. But state banks have been pressed to roll over credit lines to troubled but well-connected big firms that most private banks steer clear of. Since bond yields are held down artificially by the RBI, which buys bonds itself and forces banks to, politicians can borrow heavily without fear of a buyers’ strike. The RBI will give licences to new banks, probably early next year, and allow foreign banks to expand faster as long as they create local subsidiaries that can be regulated easily. But to reform the bond market and traditional banking he will first have to change the RBI.
