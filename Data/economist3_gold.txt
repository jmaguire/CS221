FOR over three decades Iran and America have been blood enemies. And that would open up the possibility of America and Iran co-operating more, or at least feuding less, in the world’s most troubled region. The big face-saving concession for Iran is that the regime is still permitted to continue enriching uranium. If the talks break down, Iran will not be much closer to having a bomb than it is today—and further away than it would have been without a deal. All this would take time—after 34 years America and Iran have a lot of catching up to do. The alternative was not for Iran to abandon its nuclear programme, but for America to abandon diplomacy—and prepare for an assault.
