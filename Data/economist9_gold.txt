THE interim deal concluded on November 24th between six world powers and Iran is much better than its many critics allow. In return for six months of “limited, temporary…and reversible” relief from some international sanctions, Iran has said it will not just freeze its progress towards a possible nuclear bomb, but actually take a few steps back. Under the terms of the deal (see table on next page) Iran will get rid of this stock, either by putting it in a form that is hard to enrich further or by mixing it with unenriched uranium, thus diluting it to less than 5%. Given the promise of the interim deal, ratcheting up sanctions now, as some in America’s Congress urge, is more likely to weaken international support for America’s position—and for the existing sanctions—than to draw concessions Iran would never otherwise make.
