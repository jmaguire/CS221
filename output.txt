T he ideal of a transcendental system of truth, and, corollary to it, of a system of gov ernment from on high, exercised
on earth by a v icar and represented by a church, has not yet acquired the intellectual proof w hich past ages found it to
lack. Outside of Russia this pseudo-communism has not gained much ground in spite of the fascination that alw ays attaches
to things remote in time and space -- as the old adage has it, maior e longinqXo reYerenWia. T his process of amalgamation is directly opposed to competitiv e nationalism and w ill in time destroy it entirely;
meanw hile it tends to free Europe from the psychology of nationalism and its attendant habits of thought and action. T here are those w ho question the future of the ideal of freedom. T w o conditions present
in Russia are indeed lacking in Western and Central Europe: the T sarist tradition and mysticism.
