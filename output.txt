The interim deal between Iran and six world powers hammered out in the small hours of November 24th to curb the former's nuclear programme is a long way from perfect, but it meets two key tests. The first is that it will extend Iran's so-called "critical capability"the time needed for it to produce one or several nuclear devices following a decision to weaponiseby many months compared with the trajectory it was on before the agreement. The main sanctions on oil and banking that are crippling Iran's economy remain firmly in place pending a final agreement that imposes more sweeping and permanent curbs on its nuclear programme. The final aspect of Iran's undertakings includes allowing much more intrusive inspections by the IAEA, including daily monitoring of the main enrichment facilities (with 24-hour camera surveillance) and access to Iranian scientists with the aim of establishing that there is no further (clandestine) facility. The deal struck this weekend is not yet even the beginning of the end of the danger to the world posed by the possible (actually probable) military dimensions of Iran's nuclear activities.
