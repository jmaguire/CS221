Iran and six world powers, led by America, struck the six-month interim nuclear agreement in the early hours of November 24th (see article). In Lebanon, suppose that Iran ceases using Hizbullah, its proxy, as a constant threat to the countrys stability and to Israel. It is a sponsor of terror, Bashar Assads main backer in Syria and a mortal threat to Israel. If Iran shows restraint and the world rewards it, the negotiators might generate sufficient goodwill to reach a more durable and comprehensive agreement. But the enrichment will be only to the 5% civilian level, and Iran has agreed to daily inspections of its nuclear facilities, to monitoring by cameras and to opening up more of its sites.
