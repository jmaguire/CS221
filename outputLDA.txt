The interim deal between Iran and six world powers hammered out in the small hours of November 24th to curb the former's nuclear programme is a long way from perfect, but it meets two key tests. The first is that it will extend Iran's so-called "critical capability"the time needed for it to produce one or several nuclear devices following a decision to weaponiseby many months compared with the trajectory it was on before the agreement. Secondly, it forms the basis for a more permanent solution to the decades-long problem of Iran's nuclear activities to be reached over the next six months. Under the terms of the deal, Iran has agreed to halt all enrichment above 5%, the level consistent with producing fuel for civil purposes, and to neutralise its entire stockpile of 20%-enriched uranium, which is just a few short steps from potential conversion to weapons-grade uranium. The deal struck this weekend is not yet even the beginning of the end of the danger to the world posed by the possible (actually probable) military dimensions of Iran's nuclear activities. Under the previous agreement, Iran merely committed not to begin fuelling the reactor up.
